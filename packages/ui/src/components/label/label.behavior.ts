/**
 * Label: a form control label. The composition archetype -- a static score
 * with NO state, NO actions, NO keymap, NO effects, and (like Card and
 * Container) an EMPTY, structural aria projection. A native `<label>` element
 * carries its own semantics, and the label-to-control association is the
 * native `for`/`htmlFor` IDREF attribute the consumer supplies -- so the score
 * projects nothing and owns no association logic. The surface is pure
 * decoration (a text-role token plus one of nine semantic colour variants).
 *
 * The label-control association is native, exactly as the oracle shipped it:
 * `<label for="id">` binds to `<control id="id">`. That mechanism is the
 * platform's, not the score's, so `for`/`htmlFor` is NEVER in config and
 * NEVER in the aria projection -- it passes through as a consumer-provided
 * native attribute (React `{...props}`, Astro `{...attrs}`, and the Web
 * Component forwards the host `for` onto the inner label). This is the
 * scroll-area parallel: "native scroll owns every semantic" becomes "native
 * `<label for>` owns the association." Preserving the mechanism exactly is why
 * the projection stays empty rather than reprojecting `for` through the score.
 *
 * Because the projection is empty and there is nothing to react to, Label
 * needs NO client at all: there is no `bindLabel`, the React performance uses
 * no `useBehavior`/`useMemory`, the Astro performance ships no `<script>`, and
 * the Web Component performs no binding. The score is declared only so the
 * conformance harness can assert the one real contract (the `root` part
 * renders and projects no ARIA) identically across React, the Web Component,
 * and Astro.
