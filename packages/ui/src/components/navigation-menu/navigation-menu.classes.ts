// MOTION IS CSS AND TOKENS ONLY (#2148). The hover-intent delay that used to be
// a JavaScript timer reading the `hover-intent` delay token through the DOM is
// now `transition-delay` on the reveal rule, and the reveal itself is the item's
// native `:hover` / `:focus-within` -- so the panel opens on a JS-off page.
//
// THE CELL IS THE SPEC. These utilities are the consumption of two rows of
// packages/ui/docs/spec/matrix/motion.jsonl -- navigation-menu / panel /
// "closed -> open" (moderate, enter, delay hover-intent) and navigation-menu /
// panel / "open -> closed" (fast, exit, NO delay). The old
// `createMenuHoverIntent` reused the hover-intent delay for its CLOSE timer as
// well; that was drift against the matrix, and the close is now immediate --
// still animated over the fast/exit cell, just not held back.
//
// The CLOSED cell is the base rule and the OPEN cell is the reveal rule, which
// is how a CSS transition already works: whichever rule currently applies owns
// the duration/curve/delay of the change into it.
//
// The `data-[state=open]` path is the JS-on half: keyboard opening (ArrowDown,
// Enter/Space), a controlled `value`, and a tap on a device with no hover all
// reach the panel through the score rather than through `:hover`. It carries the
// open cell's duration and curve, but NOT the hover-intent delay: that delay
// filters accidental pointer transit, and there is no accidental ArrowDown. The
// hover path keeps its delay regardless, because `group-hover` is the rule that
// declares it and nothing in the data-state group competes for transition-delay.
//
// `data-dismissed` is the WCAG 1.4.13 dismissal flag, raised by an Escape
// keydown (or by a click that closed the panel) and cleared by a deliberate
// reopen or by the pointer/focus leaving the menu. It is raised on THE DISMISSED
// PANEL, never on the root: a root-scoped force-hide blanked every panel in the
// bar at once, so after Escape a hover onto a SIBLING trigger revealed nothing
// until the pointer left the whole nav -- a dead zone the retired hover-intent
// never had. It has to win against reveal rules that are one class-level more
// specific, hence the important form: after Escape the focus returns to the
// trigger, so `:focus-within` still matches and only a force-hide can put the
// panel back down.
//
// `pointer-events` rides the transition (`transition-[opacity,pointer-events]` +
// `transition-discrete`) instead of being switched by the reveal rule, the same
// way tooltip's and hover-card's do and for the same reason: a rule that owns
// both makes the panel click-through the instant `:hover` drops, while it is
// still most of the way opaque. On the transition it flips only once the fade
// passes its halfway point, so what is visible is what is clickable. The reveal
// rules re-state `transition-property: opacity` so the flip back to `auto` on
// OPEN is immediate rather than half a fade late.
//
// NO `hidden` on the panel and no component-level reduced-motion escape.
// `hidden` is UA-stylesheet `display: none` -- it pulls the panel out of the
// accessibility tree and out of rendering, which both breaks the aria-labelledby
// announcement and kills the transition. Reduced motion is the token sheet's own
// responsibility (the exporter's REDUCED_MOTION_ZEROED set), never a
// component-level media query.
