## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Button, re-done on the settled behavior-layer pattern (#1823).** The score
  gains `bindButton` -- the DOM-native client the WC and Astro performances
  share -- proving the pattern reaches the simple-interactive archetype. The
  React controller drops `useBehavior` (createBehavior + useMemory +
  useBehaviorEffects). The native `<button>` fulfills Enter/Space as a click,
  so the bind wires click -> press only (no keydown branch); a suppressed press
  (disabled/loading/soft-disabled) cancels the default. The `announce`
  (loading) effect is edge-triggered: a button rendered already-loading
  projects `aria-busy` but does NOT announce -- the DOM-native bind proves that
  baseline suppression, the runtime loading transition is proven in the
  retained-mode (React) suite. `button.element.ts` (WC) and `button.astro`
  join. React + WC conformance green; Astro built (toolchain lands with the
  astro wave).

- **Dialog, three-framework performances on the settled pattern (#1821).** The
  score gains `bindDialog` -- the DOM-native client the WC and Astro performances
  share -- proving the pattern extends to the two overlay concerns: presence
  (content/overlay present-but-hidden so effects read light DOM) and the ongoing
  effects runner (focus-trap, scroll-lock, dismiss). The React controller drops
  `useBehavior` (createBehavior + useMemory + useBehaviorEffects; getPart by id
  since content portals; presence only for the unguarded cross-ref sources).
  `dialog.element.ts` (WC) and `dialog.astro` join. React + WC conformance green;
  Astro built (toolchain lands with the astro wave).

- **Card ported to the behavior layer -- the composition archetype, three
  frameworks.** `Card`/`CardHeader`/`CardTitle`/`CardDescription`/
  `CardContent`/`CardFooter`/`CardAction` land across React, the
  `<rafters-card>` web component, and Astro. Card is a pure static: its score
  (`card.behavior.ts`) projects no ARIA, holds no state, runs no effects --
  so there is nothing to bind. There is no `bindCard`, the React controller
  uses no `useBehavior`/`useMemory`, the Astro performance ships no `<script>`,
  and the web component performs no binding. The finding: a pure static's
  framework files are the thinnest possible -- markup + classes + slots. The
  `fill` signature replaces the default `bg-card` surface (colour vocabulary,
  #1637); the deprecated `background` prop and all editor/block/interactive
  props from the oracle are dropped. shadcn's Card family is a drop-in match.
  Conformance runs across React + WC via the shared harness; the Astro file
  SSRs the same `cardClasses` projection.
- **Input ported to the behavior layer -- the text-input archetype across
  three frameworks.** `input.behavior.ts` carries the score (a VALUE-primary
  control: `config.value` controlled/shadows, `state.value` intrinsic seed
  from `defaultValue`, effective read via `effectiveValue`) plus `bindInput`,
  the DOM-native client the `<rafters-input>` web component and the Astro
  `<script>` both perform. React (`input.tsx`) is a thin, drop-in shadcn
  `<input>` surface: it spreads props, composes the consumer's `onChange`, and
  reads the projection declaratively -- no `useBehavior`. `setValue` is gated
  by `disabled`/`readonly`; `onValueChange` fires on a real change comparing
  effective-before against intrinsic-after (so a controlled field still reports
  every edit). The score projects `aria-invalid` (always `true`/`false`),
  `aria-required`, `aria-describedby` to an error id, and `data-state`; it has
  NO effects and NO keymap -- the native `<input>` owns caret, IME, and
  selection -- making this the simplest bind in the family (value-sync + aria).
  React and WC are conformance-verified against the shared harness; `input.astro`
  ships but is unverified (no Astro test harness yet). See
  `docs/spec/components/input.md`.
- **Grid re-done on the settled behavior-layer pattern (React + WC + Astro).**
  `Grid` now carries the full three-framework surface: the score plus its
  DOM-native client `bindGrid(root)` live in `grid.behavior.ts`, the
  `<rafters-grid>` web component (`grid.element.ts`) and the Astro performance
  (`grid.astro`) both import that one client, and the React controller
  (`grid.tsx`) drops `useBehavior` for `createBehavior` + `useMemory` +
  `useBehaviorEffects`. Behavior is unchanged: presentation grids stay silent
  furniture (no role), and an honest `role="grid"` still engages the 2D
  grid-roving keyboard contract (Left/Right by 1, Up/Down by columns,
  Home/End). The `role="grid"` opt-in attribute is `grid-role` on the WC/Astro
  host (a bare `role` collides with the platform attribute and trips axe
  before the row/gridcell children exist); the binding projects the real
  `role="grid"` once the structure is present. The shared `grid-roving`
  executor now resolves the focused cell via `getRootNode()` rather than
  `document.activeElement`, so it pierces a shadow tree correctly (identical
  in light DOM).
- **Badge ported to the behavior layer.** `Badge` (React) is now a static
  score (`badge.behavior.ts` + `badge.classes.ts` + `badge.tsx`), imitating
  Container: no state, no actions, no keymap, no motion block. Full oracle
  variant vocabulary preserved (`default | primary | secondary | destructive
  | success | warning | info | muted | accent | outline | ghost | link`),
  plus the `sm | default | lg` size scale. `asChild` is not carried forward
  yet -- deferred, see `docs/spec/components/badge.md`. WC/Astro bindings
  not yet written.
- **Alert, ported to the behavior layer.** `Alert`/`AlertTitle`/`AlertDescription`/
  `AlertAction` join the new behavior-layer tree as the second sweep static
  (imitating Container). `role="alert"` is projected unconditionally by the
  score; the nine-variant severity vocabulary carries forward from the
  oracle with one fix -- each subtle background now pairs with its OWN
  subtle-foreground token instead of the solid variant's foreground, which
  was contrast-tuned for the solid fill. shadcn's `Alert`/`AlertTitle`/
  `AlertDescription` surface is a drop-in match; `AlertAction` is an
  oracle-only addition carried forward unchanged.
- **Container grid placement.** Container now accepts `colSpan` (1-12) and
  `rowSpan` (1-3), the same span vocabulary as `Grid.Item`. A Container placed
  directly inside a `Grid` can carry its own placement, so content no longer
  needs a `Grid.Item` wrapper. Available across all three render targets
  (React, Astro, and the `<rafters-container>` web component via `col-span` /
  `row-span` attributes).
