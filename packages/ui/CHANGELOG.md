## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Alert, ported to the behavior layer.** `Alert`/`AlertTitle`/`AlertDescription`/
  `AlertAction` join the new behavior-layer tree as the second sweep static
  (imitating Container). `role="alert"` is projected unconditionally by the
  score; the nine-variant severity vocabulary carries forward from the
  oracle with one fix -- each subtle background now pairs with its OWN
  subtle-foreground token instead of the solid variant's foreground, which
  was contrast-tuned for the solid fill. shadcn's `Alert`/`AlertTitle`/
  `AlertDescription` surface is a drop-in match; `AlertAction` is an
  oracle-only addition carried forward unchanged.
- **Container grid placement.** Container now accepts `colSpan` (1-12) and
  `rowSpan` (1-3), the same span vocabulary as `Grid.Item`. A Container placed
  directly inside a `Grid` can carry its own placement, so content no longer
  needs a `Grid.Item` wrapper. Available across all three render targets
  (React, Astro, and the `<rafters-container>` web component via `col-span` /
  `row-span` attributes).
